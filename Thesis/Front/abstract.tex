Writing an abstract here \ldots

\end{abstract}
    

%     As an AFIT graduate student, you are about to write one of the
%     longest documents of your career.  Whether you use a ``what you see
%     is what you get'' (WYSIWYG) interface like Microsoft Word
%     \trademark or a typesetting system like \LaTeX\ldots when you
%     create a digital document, you are writing a program.  The larger
%     any program is, the more bugs it will contain and the more likely
%     the program will result in a catastrophic error.  Common bugs
%     result in improper formating, double words, lost sentences,
%     and---in the worst case---corrupted, unreadable files.
% 
%     Typesetting systems such as \LaTeX\ limit the new lines of code
%     generated with each new document.  As a result, they produce
%     cleaner, easier-to-debug products.  Additional benefits of \LaTeX\
%     are rapid reformatting and high quality typesetting of equations
%     and vector graphics.

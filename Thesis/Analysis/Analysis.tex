\section{Introduction}
The original model from NASIC calculates a single endurance or range of an aircraft depending on inputs from a user. This method is deemed $\pm 5\%$ accurate based on comparing the ouput to explicit mission runs from a production program. With the tradeoff frontier of the developed methodology, a series of these outputs can be estimated with given flight parameters of the aircraft. To show the differences between the estimated frontier and the original model, several data points were extracted for three different aircraft, with the last aircraft having four differing loads depending on external fuel and payload. This resulted in six tests for the developed methodology.\par
\section{Analysis Aircraft Parameters}
From an individual output from the original model, the parameters of the aircraft are derived based on the averages at certain altitudes and weights as discussed in Section \ref{section:modelUsage}. The following table describes all the parameters for each of the six aircraft used.

The cruise and loiter altitude describe the altitude at which these parameters were derived. These are then estimated for different altitudes using US Standard Atmosphere. The ACX-000 aircraft is a dataset for which the aircraft is unknown to test whether the method is agnostic to an aircraft.

\section{Aircraft Tradeoff Comparison}
The tradeoff frontier was compared to the NASIC model using point statistics. Between three and eight points were generated from the NASIC model depending on the range and endurance ability of the aircraft. These points were generated at ten, twenty, and thirty minutes of endurance for all aircraft, but if an aircraft was able to endure longer, the points at 40, 60, 80, and 100 minutes of endurance may have also been generated. The difference statistics were computed as the average of the absolute value of the difference between the tradeoff frontier, $E$, and the NASIC model, $O$.
\begin{equation}
    D_{avg} = \dfrac{\sum_{i = 1}^n |O_i-E_i|}{n}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of points generated for an aircraft. In addition, the maximum difference between an expected value from the tradeoff frontier and the NASIC model were computed for each aircraft at each altitude which is a statistic of the model's variability over different endurances.

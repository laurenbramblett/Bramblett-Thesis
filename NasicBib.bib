abstract = {Traditionally, the design of a transportation system has focused on either vehicle design or the network flow, assuming the other as given. However, to define a system-level architecture for a transportation system, it is advantageous to expand the system boundary during the design process to include the network routing, the vehicle specifications, and the operations that couple the vehicle(s) and the network. In this paper, the transportation architecture is decomposed into these fundamental subsystems by classifying the decisions required to define each subsystem. Using an integrated transportation system formulation, the design of the transportation architecture can be obtained by concurrently optimizing the vehicle design and network flow. This is accomplished by embedding a linear programming solver in the perturbation step of simulated annealing to solve for the large number of linear constraints imposed by the capacity and demand requirements of the network. The benefits of this new formulation are illustrated through an example of an air transportation system for an overnight package delivery network in which a 10{\%} improvement in cost is obtained over traditional network flow optimization. The improvement in system cost obtained can be attributed to the reduction in operational inefficiencies for the transportation system.},

@article{Schumacher,
abstract = {The optimal timing of air-to-ground tasks is undertaken. Specifically, a scenario where multiple air vehicles are required to prosecute geographically dispersed targets is considered. Multiple tasks are to be successively performed on each target. The targets must be classified, attacked, and verified as destroyed. The optimal performance of these tasks requires cooperation amongst the vehicles such that critical timing constraints are satisfied. In this paper, the optimal task assignment and timing problem is posed as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The solution of the MILP assigns all tasks to the vehicles in an optimal manner, including staged departure times, for groups of air vehicles. Coupled tasks involving timing and task order constraints are addressed. When the air vehicles have sufficient endurance, the existence of a solution is guaranteed. For the case of homogeneous air vehicles, a single vehicle typically performs both classify and attack consecutively on an individual target. Accordingly, in this work, classification and attack are grouped into a single task, substantially simplifying the solution of the MILP while resulting in little loss of solution flexibility.

abstract = {This paper considers the strategic routing of a fleet of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) to service a set of predetermined targets from a prior surveillance mission. Targets are characterized by their priority or importance level, and minimum and maximum service levels that, respectively, represent the lower bound of munitions for destruction and upper bound of munitions to limit collateral damage. Additional constraints to be respected are the payload capacities of the (possibly heterogeneous) UCAV fleet and the range based on fuel capacity and payload transported. The vital aspect of this paper is the integrated optimal utilization of available resources-weaponry and flight time-while allocating targets to UCAVs and sequencing them to maximize service to targets based on their criticality. The complexity of the problem is addressed through a decomposition scheme with two problems: a target assignment problem (modeled as a minimum cost network flow problem) and a vehicle routing problem, which in turn splits into multiple decision traveling salesman problems, one for each UAV. A Tabu search heuristic is developed to coordinate the two problems. Using test problems we establish the applicability of this approach to solve practical-sized problems. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For this purpose, we have reviewed and compiled a rich set of 175 benchmark functions for unconstrained optimization problems with diverse properties in terms of modality, separability, and valley landscape.

abstract = {Environmental concerns and the rising cost of crude oil have incentivized the search for alternative aviation fuels. However, any potential alternatives must be thoroughly characterized and tested. In this investigation nine potential biofuels derived from sustainable sources were tested for their compatibility with Jet A-1 aviation kerosene. The fuels chosen were n-butanol, n-hexanol, butyl levulinate, butyl butyrate, ethyl octanoate, methyl linolenate, farnesene, ethyl cyclohexane and limonene. Viscosities were determined between -30 and 40. °C and were observed to increase with decreasing temperature roughly in accordance with ideal fluid behavior. Cloud point temperatures of all samples were tested and all fuels except n-butanol and methyl linolenate were found to be below the specification maximum. Flash points of all fuels apart from pure and blends of ethyl cyclohexane and n-butanol were found to be greater than 38. °C, the minimum threshold specified in the standard. Of all the samples only the hydrocarbon fuels met the required energy content minimum with energy content decreasing with increasing oxygen content. The effect of each fuel on the range vs. the payload, relative to Jet A-1 was determined using a simplified model in order to ascertain likely impact of adoption upon airline operations. Only limonene fulfilled all the requirements of an alternative aviation fuel, though butyl butyrate and ethyl octanoate were acceptable except for the reduced energy density. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Tradeoffs,
abstract = {Rotorcraft design has always been a challenging tradeoff among overall size, capabilities, complexity, and other factors based on available technology and customer requirements. Advancements in propulsion, energy systems and other technologies have enabled new vehicles and missions; complementary advances in analysis methods and tools enable exploration of these enhanced vehicles and the evolving mission design space. A system study was performed to better understand the interdependency between vehicle design and propulsion system capabilities versus hover / loiter requirements and range capability. Three representative vertical lift vehicles were developed to explore the tradeoff in capability between hover efficiency versus range and endurance capability. The vehicles were a single-main rotor helicopter, a tilt rotor, and a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. Vehicle capability was limited to two or three people (including pilot or crew) and maximum range within one hour of flight (100-200 miles, depending on vehicle). Two types of propulsion and energy storage systems were used in this study. First was traditional hydrocarbon-fueled cycles (such as Otto, diesel or gas turbine cycles). Second was an all-electric system using electric motors, power management and distribution, assuming batteries for energy storage, with the possibility of hydrocarbon-fueled range extenders. The high power requirements for hover significantly reduced mission radius capability. Loiter was less power intensive, resulting in about ½ the equivalent mission radius penalty. With so many design variables, the VTOL aircraft has the potential to perform well for a variety of missions. This vehicle is a good candidate for additional study; component model development is also required to adequately assess performance over the design space of interest.

The overall objective is to minimize the mission completion time for the fleet, and the task assignment must account for differing UAV capabilities and no-fly zones. Loitering times are included as extra degrees of freedom in the problem to help meet the timing constraints. The overall problem is formulated using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), which gives the globally optimal solution. An approximate decomposition solution method is also used to overcome the computational issues that arise when using MILP for larger problems. The problem is also posed in a way that can be solved using Tabu search. This approach is demonstrated to provide good solutions in reasonable computation times for large problems that are very difficult to solve using the exact or approximate decomposition methods.},

abstract = {We present a novel framework for exploring very large state spaces of concurrent reactive systems. Our framework exploits application-independent heuristics using genetic algorithms to guide a state-space search towards error states. We have implemented this framework in conjunction with VeriSoft, a tool for exploring the state spaces of software applications composed of several concurrent processes executing arbitrary code. We present experimental results obtained with several examples of programs, including a C implementation of a public-key authentication protocol. We discuss heuristics and properties of state spaces that help a genetic search detect deadlocks and assertion violations. For finding errors in very large state spaces, our experiments show that a genetic search using simple heuristics can significantly outperform random and systematic searches.},

abstract = {This paper presents a genetic algorithmic approach to the shortest path (SP) routing problem. Variable-length chromosomes (strings) and their genes (parameters) have been used for encoding the problem. The crossover operation exchanges partial chromosomes (partial routes) at positionally independent crossing sites and the mutation operation maintains the genetic diversity of the population. The proposed algorithm can cure all the infeasible chromosomes with a simple repair function. Crossover and mutation together provide a search capability that results in improved quality of solution and enhanced rate of convergence. This paper also develops a population-sizing equation that facilitates a solution with desired quality. It is based on the gambler's ruin model; the equation has been further enhanced and generalized, however. The equation relates the size of the population, the quality of solution , the cardinality of the alphabet, and other parameters of the proposed algorithm. Computer simulations show that the proposed algorithm exhibits a much better quality of solution (route optimality) and a much higher rate of convergence than other algorithms. The results are relatively independent of problem types (network sizes and topologies) for almost all source-destination pairs. Furthermore, simulation studies emphasize the usefulness of the population-sizing equation. The equation scales to larger networks. It is felt that it can be used for determining an adequate population size (for a desired quality of solution) in the SP routing problem.

In the first part, the paper presents the voltage regulation in IEEE buses using the Static Compensator (STATIC) and discusses efficient ways to solve the power systems featuring STATCOM by load flow equations. The load flow equations are solved using iterative algorithms such as Newton-Raphson method. In the second part, the paper focuses on the use of estimation techniques based on Artificial Neural Networks as an alternative to the iterative methods. Different training algorithms have been used for training the weights of Artificial Neural Networks; these methods include Back-Propagation, Particle Swarm Optimization, Shuffled Frog Leap Algorithm, and Genetic Algorithm. A performance analysis of each of these methods is done on the IEEE bus data to examine the efficiency of each algorithm. The results show that SFLA outperforms other techniques in training of ANN, seconded by PSO.},

abstract = {This paper explains the new concept of buffered probability of exceedance (bPOE). Through averaging of data in the tail, bPOE compactly presents probability as well as loss value of the tail and has the capability to revolutionize the concept of risk-averse engineering. bPOE is demonstrated using tropical storm damage along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the USA from 1900 to 2013 (average yearly damage {\$}14.776 billion). It can be shown, under general assumptions, that bPOE is more than double the probability of exceedance (POE). For instance, with a {\$}50 billion threshold of damages per year, POE is 10.6 {\%}, while the bPOE is 26.1 {\%}. We also considered expected excess (EE) over some threshold (deductible), which is a minimum premium that insurer should charge per year. We demonstrate that EE equals the difference between the damage associated with POE and bPOE multiplied by bPOE. For instance, for a 25 {\%} tail probability, the value at risk (quantile) determined using POE is {\$}11.181 billion, while the conditional value at risk (average damage in excess of the quantile) determined by the bPOE is {\$}51.753 billion. This {\$}40.572 difference leads to EE of 0.25 * {\$}40.572 = {\$}10.143 billion over the threshold {\$}11.181 billion. Furthermore, subdividing the data by landfall state, at the 50 {\%} probability level, Florida, the state most often hit by tropical storms also has the highest value for EE at {\$}8.111 billion; thus, quantifying the need for insurers to charge Floridians high insurance premiums.},

@article{MafusalovbPOE,
abstract = {This paper studies a probabilistic characteristic called buffered probability of ex-ceedance (bPOE). It is a function of a random variable and a real-valued threshold. By definition, bPOE is the probability of a tail such that the average of this tail equals the threshold. This char-acteristic is an extension of the so-called buffered failure probability and it is equal to one minus inverse of the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). bPOE is a quasi-convex function of the random variable w.r.t. the regular addition operation and a concave function w.r.t. the mixture operation; it is a monotonic function of the random variable; it is a strictly decreasing function of the threshold on the interval between the expectation and the essential supremum. The multiplicative inverse of the bPOE is a convex function of the threshold, and a piecewise-linear function in the case of discretely distributed random variable. The paper provides efficient calculation formulas for bPOE. Minimization of bPOE is reduced to a convex program for a convex feasible region and to linear programming for a polyhedral feasible region and discretely distributed random variables. A family of bPOE minimization problems and corresponding CVaR minimization problems share the same set of optimal solutions. 1. Introduction. Many optimization problems in an uncertain environment deal with undesired occurrences. Natural hazard, portfolio value fluctuation, server overloading, and large nuclear emission value are examples from different areas. We suppose that a loss function for a system should be minimized or constrained. For instance, we can consider a largest (most worrying) loss, which should be treated care-fully. A popular approach is to set a threshold for the loss and estimate the number of instances for which the threshold is exceeded. Then, in an optimization setting or with a risk management policy, this number is bounded in some sense, i.e., forced to be lower than a certain fraction of the overall occurrences. For example, nuclear safety regulations bound the frequency of radiation release exceeding a specified threshold. Alternatively, frequency (or probability) of exceedance of a threshold is minimized. Similarly, in data-mining problems the number of misclassified objects, defined by a score-function exceeding some threshold, is minimized. We want to point out that the number of losses exceeding the threshold does not provide any information on how large these losses are. What if these events, even if they have low probability, destroy the whole system or cause an irrecoverable damage? We advocate for an alternative measure which counts the number of the largest losses, such that the average of these losses is equal to the threshold. This measure is more conservative (more},

abstract = {This paper investigates the constrained shortest path problem in a transportation network where the link travel times are assumed to be random variables defined on the basis of joint probability mass functions. A 0-1 integer programming model is formulated to find the least expected travel time paths. Besides the flow balance and side constraints, the unique link selection constraint is particularly introduced to guarantee that only an optimal path can be finally generated. Then, a Lagrangian relaxation solution approach is provided to relax the hard constraints and decompose the relaxed model into two parts. An algorithmic framework, integrating the sub-gradient algorithm, label-correcting algorithm and K-shortest path algorithm, is designed to minimize the gap between the upper and lower bounds to find near-optimal solutions. An extension that considers the joint probability mass functions of link travel times varying with time is discussed. We decompose the time-dependent problem into three subproblems and solve it by the modified algorithmic framework. Computational tests are conducted on different scales of transportation networks. Experimental results in a large-scale network indicate that the proposed algorithm can quickly find the high-quality solutions with small relative gaps, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

abstract = {Computing shortest paths with two or more conflicting optimization criteria is a fundamental problem in transportation and logistics. We study the problem of finding all Pareto-optimal solutions for the multi-criteria single-source shortest-path problem with nonnegative edge lengths. The standard approaches are generalizations of label-setting (Dijkstra) and label-correcting algorithms, in which the distance labels are multi-dimensional and more than one distance label is maintained for each node. The crucial parameter for the run time and space consumption is the total number of Pareto optima. In general, this value can be exponentially large in the input size. However, in various practical applications one can observe that the input data has certain characteristics, which may lead to a much smaller number---small enough to make the problem efficiently tractable from a practical viewpoint. For typical characteristics which occur in various applications we study in this paper whether we can bound the size of the Pareto set to a polynomial size or not. These characteristics are also evaluated (1) on a concrete application scenario (computing the set of best train connections in view of travel time, fare, and number of train changes) and (2) on a simplified randomized model. It will turn out that the number of Pareto optima on each visited node is restricted by a small constant in our concrete application, and that the size of the Pareto set is much smaller than our worst case bounds in the randomized model.},

@article{Forecasting Ozone,
abstract = {A neural network combined to a neural classifier is used in a real time forecasting of hourly maximum ozone in the centre of France, in an urban atmosphere. This neural model is based on the MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) structure. The inputs of the statistical network are model output statistics of the weather predictions from the French National Weather Service. These predicted meteorological parameters are very easily available through an air quality network. The lead time used in this forecasting is (t + 24) h. Efforts are related to a regularisation method which is based on a Bayesian Information Criterion-like and to the determination of a confidence interval of forecasting. We offer a statistical validation between various statistical models and a deterministic chemistry-transport model. In this experiment, with the final neural network, the ozone peaks are fairly well predicted (in terms of global fit), with an Agreement Index = 92{\%}, the Mean Absolute Error = the Root Mean Square Error = 15 $\mu$g m-3 and the Mean Bias Error = 5 $\mu$g m-3, where the European threshold of the hourly ozone is 180 $\mu$g m-3. To improve the performance of this exceedance forecasting, instead of the previous model, we use a neural classifier with a sigmoid function in the output layer. The output of the network ranges from [0,1] and can be interpreted as the probability of exceedance of the threshold. This model is compared to a classical logistic regression. With this neural classifier, the Success Index of forecasting is 78{\%} whereas it is from 65{\%} to 72{\%} with the classical MLPs. During the validation phase, in the Summer of 2003, six ozone peaks above the threshold were detected. They actually were seven. Finally, the model called NEUROZONE is now used in real time. New data will be introduced in the training data each year, at the end of September. The network will be re-trained and new regression parameters estimated. So, one of the main difficulties in the training phase - namely the low frequency of ozone peaks above the threshold in this region - will be solved. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Zabarankin2002,
abstract = {Analytical and discrete optimization approaches for routing an aircraft in a threat environment have been developed. Using these approaches, an aircraft's optimal risk trajectory with a constraint on the path length can be efficiently calculated. The analytical approach based on calculus of variations reduces the original risk optimization problem to the system of nonlinear differential equations. The solution of such a system in the case of a single radar-installation is expressed by the elliptic sine. The discrete optimization approach reformulates the problem as the Weight Constrained Shortest Path Problem (WCSPP) for a grid undirected graph. The WCSPP is efficiently solved by the Modified Label Setting Algorithm (MLSA). Both approaches have been tested with several numerical examples. Discrete nonsmooth solutions with high precision coincide with exact continuous solutions. For the same graph, time in which the discrete optimization algorithm computes the optimal trajectory is independent of the number of radars. The discrete approach is also efficient for solving the problem using different risk functions.},

@article{Chopra,
abstract = {Natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism and more mundane risks can seriously disrupt or delay the flow of material, information and cash through an organization's supply chain. The authors assert that how well a company fares against such threats will depend on its level of preparedness, and the type of disruption. Each supply-chain risk - to forecasts, information systems, intellectual property, procurement, inventory and capacity - has its own drivers and effective mitigation strategies. To avoid lost sales, increased costs or both, managers need to tailor proven risk-reduction strategies to their organizations. Managing supply-chain risk is difficult, however. Dell, Toyota, Motorola and other leading manufacturers excel at identifying and neutralizing supply-chain risks through a delicate balancing act: keeping inventory, capacity and related elements at appropriate levels across the entire supply chain in a rapidly changing environment. Organizations can prepare for or avoid delays by "smart sizing" their capacity and inventory. The manager serves as a kind of financial portfolio manager, seeking to achieve the highest achievable profits (reward) for varying levels of supply-chain risk. The authors recommend a powerful what if? team exercise called stress testing to identify potentially weak links in the supply chain. Armed with this shared understanding, companies can then select the best mitigation strategy: holding "reserves," pooling inventory, using redundant suppliers, balancing capacity and inventory, implementing robust backup and recovery systems, adjusting pricing and incentives, bringing or keeping production in-house, and using Continuous Replenishment Programs (CRP), Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) and other supply-chain initiatives.},

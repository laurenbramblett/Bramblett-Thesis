abstract = {This paper considers the strategic routing of a fleet of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) to service a set of predetermined targets from a prior surveillance mission. Targets are characterized by their priority or importance level, and minimum and maximum service levels that, respectively, represent the lower bound of munitions for destruction and upper bound of munitions to limit collateral damage. Additional constraints to be respected are the payload capacities of the (possibly heterogeneous) UCAV fleet and the range based on fuel capacity and payload transported. The vital aspect of this paper is the integrated optimal utilization of available resources-weaponry and flight time-while allocating targets to UCAVs and sequencing them to maximize service to targets based on their criticality. The complexity of the problem is addressed through a decomposition scheme with two problems: a target assignment problem (modeled as a minimum cost network flow problem) and a vehicle routing problem, which in turn splits into multiple decision traveling salesman problems, one for each UAV. A Tabu search heuristic is developed to coordinate the two problems. Using test problems we establish the applicability of this approach to solve practical-sized problems. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A visualization methodology is presented in which a Pareto Frontier can be visualized in an intuitive and straightforward manner for an n-dimensional performance space. Based on this visualization, it is possible to quickly identify ‘good' regions of the performance and optimal design spaces for a multi-objective optimization application, regardless of space complexity. Visualizing Pareto solutions for more than three objectives has long been a significant challenge to the multi-objective optimization community. The Hyper-space Diagonal Counting (HSDC) method described here enables the lossless visualization to be implemented. The proposed method requires no dimension fixing. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of visualizing n-f space (i.e. for more than three objective functions in a multiobjective optimization problem). The visualization is shown to aid in the final decision of what potential optimal design point should be chosen amongst all possible Pareto solutions.},

abstract = {Traditionally, the design of a transportation system has focused on either vehicle design or the network flow, assuming the other as given. However, to define a system-level architecture for a transportation system, it is advantageous to expand the system boundary during the design process to include the network routing, the vehicle specifications, and the operations that couple the vehicle(s) and the network. In this paper, the transportation architecture is decomposed into these fundamental subsystems by classifying the decisions required to define each subsystem. Using an integrated transportation system formulation, the design of the transportation architecture can be obtained by concurrently optimizing the vehicle design and network flow. This is accomplished by embedding a linear programming solver in the perturbation step of simulated annealing to solve for the large number of linear constraints imposed by the capacity and demand requirements of the network. The benefits of this new formulation are illustrated through an example of an air transportation system for an overnight package delivery network in which a 10{\%} improvement in cost is obtained over traditional network flow optimization. The improvement in system cost obtained can be attributed to the reduction in operational inefficiencies for the transportation system.},

abstract = {Environmental concerns and the rising cost of crude oil have incentivized the search for alternative aviation fuels. However, any potential alternatives must be thoroughly characterized and tested. In this investigation nine potential biofuels derived from sustainable sources were tested for their compatibility with Jet A-1 aviation kerosene. The fuels chosen were n-butanol, n-hexanol, butyl levulinate, butyl butyrate, ethyl octanoate, methyl linolenate, farnesene, ethyl cyclohexane and limonene. Viscosities were determined between -30 and 40. °C and were observed to increase with decreasing temperature roughly in accordance with ideal fluid behavior. Cloud point temperatures of all samples were tested and all fuels except n-butanol and methyl linolenate were found to be below the specification maximum. Flash points of all fuels apart from pure and blends of ethyl cyclohexane and n-butanol were found to be greater than 38. °C, the minimum threshold specified in the standard. Of all the samples only the hydrocarbon fuels met the required energy content minimum with energy content decreasing with increasing oxygen content. The effect of each fuel on the range vs. the payload, relative to Jet A-1 was determined using a simplified model in order to ascertain likely impact of adoption upon airline operations. Only limonene fulfilled all the requirements of an alternative aviation fuel, though butyl butyrate and ethyl octanoate were acceptable except for the reduced energy density. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Tradeoffs,
abstract = {Rotorcraft design has always been a challenging tradeoff among overall size, capabilities, complexity, and other factors based on available technology and customer requirements. Advancements in propulsion, energy systems and other technologies have enabled new vehicles and missions; complementary advances in analysis methods and tools enable exploration of these enhanced vehicles and the evolving mission design space. A system study was performed to better understand the interdependency between vehicle design and propulsion system capabilities versus hover / loiter requirements and range capability. Three representative vertical lift vehicles were developed to explore the tradeoff in capability between hover efficiency versus range and endurance capability. The vehicles were a single-main rotor helicopter, a tilt rotor, and a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. Vehicle capability was limited to two or three people (including pilot or crew) and maximum range within one hour of flight (100-200 miles, depending on vehicle). Two types of propulsion and energy storage systems were used in this study. First was traditional hydrocarbon-fueled cycles (such as Otto, diesel or gas turbine cycles). Second was an all-electric system using electric motors, power management and distribution, assuming batteries for energy storage, with the possibility of hydrocarbon-fueled range extenders. The high power requirements for hover significantly reduced mission radius capability. Loiter was less power intensive, resulting in about ½ the equivalent mission radius penalty. With so many design variables, the VTOL aircraft has the potential to perform well for a variety of missions. This vehicle is a good candidate for additional study; component model development is also required to adequately assess performance over the design space of interest.

The overall objective is to minimize the mission completion time for the fleet, and the task assignment must account for differing UAV capabilities and no-fly zones. Loitering times are included as extra degrees of freedom in the problem to help meet the timing constraints. The overall problem is formulated using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), which gives the globally optimal solution. An approximate decomposition solution method is also used to overcome the computational issues that arise when using MILP for larger problems. The problem is also posed in a way that can be solved using Tabu search. This approach is demonstrated to provide good solutions in reasonable computation times for large problems that are very difficult to solve using the exact or approximate decomposition methods.},

abstract = {The optimal timing of air-to-ground tasks is undertaken. Specifically, a scenario where multiple air vehicles are required to prosecute geographically dispersed targets is considered. Multiple tasks are to be successively performed on each target. The targets must be classified, attacked, and verified as destroyed. The optimal performance of these tasks requires cooperation amongst the vehicles such that critical timing constraints are satisfied. In this paper, the optimal task assignment and timing problem is posed as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The solution of the MILP assigns all tasks to the vehicles in an optimal manner, including staged departure times, for groups of air vehicles. Coupled tasks involving timing and task order constraints are addressed. When the air vehicles have sufficient endurance, the existence of a solution is guaranteed. For the case of homogeneous air vehicles, a single vehicle typically performs both classify and attack consecutively on an individual target. Accordingly, in this work, classification and attack are grouped into a single task, substantially simplifying the solution of the MILP while resulting in little loss of solution flexibility.

abstract = {In this paper, we present, test, and compare two novel methods to solve the aircraft routing problem with aerial refueling with a multicriteria objective function. We present a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that utilizes a combination of a network transformation and a formulation that creatively decouples refueling decisions from the nodes within the network. We also present a dynamic program (DP) that, when coupled with an alternative network transformation to account for the multiple criteria within the objective function, applies a node-labeling approach based on a modification of Dijkstra{\&}rsquo;s algorithm. We test and compare these alternative solution methods on a set of 264 synthetically-generated instances representing 66 combinations of network size and the frequency of aerial refueling point availability. Invoking CPLEX using the C++ callable library to solve the MILP and applying the DP in C++, we found that the application of the DP yields a 98.97 {\%} reduction in the required computational effort, on average, relative to the MILP; the MILP fails to find an optimal solution within a 3,600-s time limit for selected instances of networks having at least 80 nodes and for all instances of networks having at least 350 nodes. In contrast, the DP is more robust than the MILP, as it only requires longer than 3,600 s to solve selected instances of networks having more than 3,000 nodes. {\&}copy; 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA)},
